# NetCDF Diag Read Library
# Makefile library configuration for building with nc_diag_read
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Do NOT modify this file. Everything has been set up automatically
# for you! Modifying this file may break things!
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Usage:
#     To use this file, simply include it within your Makefile:
#         include /path/to/nc_diag_read/Makefile.config
#     
#     Then use the nc_diag_read specific build variables:
#         $(F90) [your stuff here] $(NC_DIAG_READ_FLAGS)
#     Note that $(NC_DIAG_READ_FLAGS) MUST go after your source files
#     (and/or your own build flags). Failure to do so will cause build
#     problems.
#     
#     Finally, you must include the NetCDF libraries and includes. The
#     NetCDF flags should go AFTER the nc_diag_read flags (as well as
#     any other libraries that use NetCDF). This is due to the
#     dependency order, where libraries that need to use NetCDF need to
#     be added first so that the compiler knows to search and link
#     NetCDF libraries.
#     
#     Your final build command should look something like this:
#         $(F90) [...] $(NC_DIAG_READ_FLAGS) $(NETCDF_FLAGS)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Integration:
#     If you would also like to integrate nc_diag_read building with
#     your source, you can do the following:
#     
#     First, add the nc_diag_read library to your dependencies. We
#     already figured out the path for you, so all you have to do is
#     just add it! Use NCDR_LIB_PATH to get that path:
#         mytarget: srcfiles ... $(NCDR_LIB_PATH)
#             [your build commands here]
#     
#     Alternatively, if you want to use your specific dependencies, you
#     can simply add this to your "all" target, making this MUCH
#     cleaner:
#         all: $(NCDR_LIB_PATH) myexecs ...
#     Note that this only works as long as you build with "all".
#     Building with specific targets will forgo this dependency.
#     
#     Of course, you really want to also be able to build said library
#     as well! Simply add the following target and build command, and
#     everything should work:
#         $(NCDR_LIB_PATH): $(NCDR_LIB_DEPS)
#             $(NCDR_BUILD_CMD)
#     
#     Now, if nc_diag_read gets updated, or it hasn't been built yet,
#     the library will automatically get (re-)built when you build
#     your program!
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# That's it - everything else is stuff on our end!
# 
# As a friendly reminder, do *NOT* change or touch anything below!
# We've set up everything so that you can just include this file and
# start using nc_diag_read! Changing anything below WILL cause
# problems!
# 
# If you're really stuck, try looking at the Makefile in tests/ - we
# include this Makefile.libconfig and set things up according to the
# steps above!
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 

# The following doesn't work - it only considers the base Makefile, not
# the included one...
# 
# NCDR_MAKEFILE := $(abspath $(lastword $(MAKEFILE_LIST)))
# 
# This also doesn't work if we use an absolute path:
# NCDR_MAKEFILE := $(CURDIR)/$(word $(words $(MAKEFILE_LIST)),$(MAKEFILE_LIST))
# 
# This doesn't work, either:
# NCDR_PATH := $(notdir $(patsubst %/,%,$(dir $(NCDR_MAKEFILE))))

# First, use a trick to get the included (Makefile.libconfig) path:
# Check if we are using an absolute path - aka we have a slash.
# If we don't, process with relative path...

    #$(warning Using absolute paths!)
    NCDR_MAKEFILE := $(abspath $(word $(words $(MAKEFILE_LIST)),$(MAKEFILE_LIST)))
    # Then, get the directory for this file:
    NCDR_PATH := $(patsubst %/,%,$(dir $(NCDR_MAKEFILE)))
else
    #$(warning Using relative paths!)
    NCDR_MAKEFILE := $(CURDIR)/$(word $(words $(MAKEFILE_LIST)),$(MAKEFILE_LIST))
    # Then, get the directory for this file.
    # We yank out the directory to get a relative path.

# Define nc_diag_read library dependencies, so that any changes
# can prompt a re-build:

# Define the build command necessary to build this library:

NC_DIAG_READ_FLAGS=-I$(NCDR_PATH) -L$(NCDR_PATH) -lnc_diag_read
