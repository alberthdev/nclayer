# TODO FOR nc_diag_write
 -> get rid of the NLAYER type and fill constants - the NF90_* ones work
    just as well!
 -> rip out the silly allocation multiplier stuff - get rid of the type
    and subroutines, and just reallocate like this:
    
    new_size = old_size * 2
 -> move the actual nf90 def locking (nf90_enddef) to our lockdef, and
    have our nc_diag_write call our own def lock
 -> private/public for funcs and subs - you really, really, really don't
    want people to call functions that are private!
 -> clarify naming schemes for write/finish - finish is super tempting
    to call...
     -> make nc_diag_write just write + lock data, and maybe make
        nc_diag_finish public? so we can have a solely data/def lock
        mode, with the ability to still do varattr fun
